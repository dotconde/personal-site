## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
It reduces the complexity of state management.

`Important:` Hooks don't work inside classes ‚Äî they let you use React without classes.

## What is useState ?

useState is probably the most used hook in React. Basically, useState allow us to
`store` and `manipulate` data. That's it.

Let's try with a basic example.

```js
const [age, setAge] = useState(23);
```

- `age`: Stores an array of your friends (Yes, you can use an object too, but since this is a basic example, let's try with an array)
- `setAge`: Function responsible for making modifications in `age`

Let's play with some buttons and my age üë®‚Äçüíª

#### Explanation:

We created a React template and if we
click `Younger` our age will decrease by one or increase if we click `Older`.
Why isn't it working? It does not work because we have not defined how we will update our status. So, right now we will fix that.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(23);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <button>Younger</button>
      <button>Older</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Explanation:

It's fixed and now we are able to update our state.
First button will handle its clicks with `handleYounger`.
What `handleYounger` does? Update `age` value through `setAge`. The second button works similarly.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(23);

  const handleYounger = () => {
    setAge(age - 1);
  };

  const handleOlder = () => {
    setAge(age + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <button onClick={handleYounger}> Younger </button>
      <button onClick={handleOlder}> Older </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Recommendation

You will have a great advantage if you learn how to work with useState and useEffect, you will spend 99% of your time dealing with these two concepts.
Opps ... Did I mention useEffect? You will probably see an article explaining it.
