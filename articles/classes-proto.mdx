## Classes & prototype in Javascript

What to do when you have a huge project and you need an specific function ?
You will try to hunt out that specific function and time is money.

#### Factory function: Create an object and assign properties.

```js
const user1 = {
  name: "David",
  score: 3,
  increment: function () {
    user1.score++;
  },
};
```

```js
const user2 = {
  name: "Jefferson",
  score: 6,
  increment: function () {
    user2.score++;
  },
};
```

In professional code enviroment we tend not to say key-value. I recommend you to call them `property name` and `property value`

#### Factory function: Alternative way to to create and assign properties.

```js
const user3 = Object.create(null);
user3.name = "Victoria";
user3.score = 9;
user3.increment = function () {
  user3.score++;
};
```

I could pass in an object in there full of objects full of properties, numbers or strings. I can pass almost anything.
But until this point don't you think we are too repetitive ? ðŸ¤” DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

#### Solution 1: Generate objects using a function

```js
function userGenerator(name, score) {
  const newUser = {};
  newUser.name = name;
  newUser.score = score;
  newUser.increment = function () {
    newUser.score++;
  };
  return newUser;
}

const user1 = userGenerator("David", 3);
const user2 = userGenerator("Jefferson", 6);
user1.increment();
```
